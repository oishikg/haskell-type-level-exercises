# GHC exercises ðŸš€

OK, you know your **monoids** from your **monads**. You know how to write a
terminal application or two. What's next? What are these language extensions
that keep being mentioned? How "type-safe" can you _really_ be?

This repository, I hope, will provide some **stepping stones**. We'll go
through extensions one at a time, and build up a richer vocabulary for talking
about Haskell programs, and look to move our assertions up into types, where
they can be verified at compile time.

I can't make any guarantees as to how quickly this repository will fill up, but
I'm looking to publish at least a section per week.

## What this _isn't_.

This is a deep dive into GHC extensions, the power that each one gives us, and
how we can combine extensions to achieve very strong guarantees at
compile-time. This is _not_ based around concepts; there won't be sections on
"dependently-typed programming", or "generic programming", though these
concepts will turn up throughout as we dig deeper into the extensions.
